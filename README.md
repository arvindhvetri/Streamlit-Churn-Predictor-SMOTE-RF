# 📊 Customer Churn Predictor

A sleek and interactive **Customer Churn Prediction** app built with **Streamlit** and powered by a **SMOTE-enhanced Random Forest** model.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a service) based on key input features. It uses:

- ✅ Random Forest Classifier  
- 🔁 SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the dataset  
- 🎯 High-performance model with **94% accuracy**  
- 🌐 Deployed using **Streamlit** for a smooth user interface

## 🧠 Model Performance

| Metric       | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | 93.96% |
| **Precision** | 93–95% |
| **Recall**    | 91–96% |
| **F1 Score**  | 93–95% |
